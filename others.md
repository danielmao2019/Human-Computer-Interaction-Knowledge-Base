    * Title: Survey of Human Models for Verification of Human-Machine Systems
    * Year: 25 Jul `2023`
    * Authors: Timothy E. Wang, Alessandro Pinto
    * Abstract: We survey the landscape of human operator modeling ranging from the early cognitive models developed in artificial intelligence to more recent formal task models developed for model-checking of human machine interactions. We review human performance modeling and human factors studies in the context of aviation, and models of how the pilot interacts with automation in the cockpit. The purpose of the survey is to assess the applicability of available state-of-the-art models of the human operators for the design, verification and validation of future safety-critical aviation systems that exhibit higher-level of autonomy, but still require human operators in the loop. These systems include the single-pilot aircraft and NextGen air traffic management. We discuss the gaps in existing models and propose future research to address them.

    * Title: A Survey on Personalized Affective Computing in Human-Machine Interaction
    * Year: 01 Apr `2023`
    * Authors: Jialin Li, Alia Waleed, Hanan Salam
    * Abstract: In computing, the aim of personalization is to train a model that caters to a specific individual or group of people by optimizing one or more performance metrics and adhering to specific constraints. In this paper, we discuss the need for personalization in affective and personality computing (hereinafter referred to as affective computing). We present a survey of state-of-the-art approaches for personalization in affective computing. Our review spans training techniques and objectives towards the personalization of affective computing models. We group existing approaches into seven categories: (1) Target-specific Models, (2) Group-specific Models, (3) Weighting-based Approaches, (4) Fine-tuning Approaches, (5) Multitask Learning, (6) Generative-based Models, and (7) Feature Augmentation. Additionally, we provide a statistical meta-analysis of the surveyed literature, analyzing the prevalence of different affective computing tasks, interaction modes, interaction contexts, and the level of personalization among the surveyed works. Based on that, we provide a road-map for those who are interested in exploring this direction.

    * Title: Human Digital Twin: A Survey
    * Year: 12 Dec `2022`

    * Abstract: Digital twin has recently attracted growing attention, leading to intensive research and applications. Along with this, a new research area, dubbed as "human digital twin" (HDT), has emerged. Similar to the conception of digital twin, HDT is referred to as the replica of a physical-world human in the digital world. Nevertheless, HDT is much more complicated and delicate compared to digital twins of any physical systems and processes, due to humans' dynamic and evolutionary nature, including physical, behavioral, social, physiological, psychological, cognitive, and biological dimensions. Studies on HDT are limited, and the research is still in its infancy. In this paper, we first examine the inception, development, and application of the digital twin concept, providing a context within which we formally define and characterize HDT based on the similarities and differences between digital twin and HDT. Then we conduct an extensive literature review on HDT research, analyzing underpinning technologies and establishing typical frameworks in which the core HDT functions or components are organized. Built upon the findings from the above work, we propose a generic architecture for the HDT system and describe the core function blocks and corresponding technologies. Following this, we present the state of the art of HDT technologies and applications in the healthcare, industry, and daily life domain. Finally, we discuss various issues related to the development of HDT and point out the trends and challenges of future HDT research and development.

    * Title: Multi-Modal Data Fusion in Enhancing Human-Machine Interaction for Robotic Applications: A Survey
    * Year: 15 Feb `2022`
    * Authors: Tauheed Khan Mohd, Nicole Nguyen, Ahmad Y Javaid
    * Abstract: Human-machine interaction has been around for several decades now, with new applications emerging every day. One of the major goals that remain to be achieved is designing an interaction similar to how a human interacts with another human. Therefore, there is a need to develop interactive systems that could replicate a more realistic and easier human-machine interaction. On the other hand, developers and researchers need to be aware of state-of-the-art methodologies being used to achieve this goal. We present this survey to provide researchers with state-of-the-art data fusion technologies implemented using multiple inputs to accomplish a task in the robotic application domain. Moreover, the input data modalities are broadly classified into uni-modal and multi-modal systems and their application in myriad industries, including the health care industry, which contributes to the medical industry's future development. It will help the professionals to examine patients using different modalities. The multi-modal systems are differentiated by a combination of inputs used as a single input, e.g., gestures, voice, sensor, and haptic feedback. All these inputs may or may not be fused, which provides another classification of multi-modal systems. The survey concludes with a summary of technologies in use for multi-modal systems.

    * Title: A Survey on Brain-Computer Interaction
    * Year: 04 Jan `2022`
    * Authors: Bosubabu Sambana, Priyanka Mishra
    * Abstract: Brain-Computer Interface(BCI) systems support communication through direct measures of neural activity without muscle activity. Brain-Computer Interface systems need to be validated in long-term studies of real-world use by people with severe disabilities, and effective and viable models for their widespread dissemination must be implemented. Finally, the day-to-day and moment-to-moment reliability of BCI performance must be improved so that approaches the reliability of natural muscle-based function. This review discusses the structure and functions of BCI systems, clarifies terminology integration and progress, and opportunities in the field are also identified and explicated based on the current availability of invasive recording technologies used for BCI systems.
