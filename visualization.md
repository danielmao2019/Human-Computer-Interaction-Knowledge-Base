    * Title: Maybe, Maybe Not: A Survey on Uncertainty in Visualization
    * Year: 14 Dec `2022`
    * Authors: Krisha Mehta
    * Abstract: Understanding and evaluating uncertainty play a key role in decision-making. When a viewer studies a visualization that demands inference, it is necessary that uncertainty is portrayed in it. This paper showcases the importance of representing uncertainty in visualizations. It provides an overview of uncertainty visualization and the challenges authors and viewers face when working with such charts. I divide the visualization pipeline into four parts, namely data collection, preprocessing, visualization, and inference, to evaluate how uncertainty impacts them. Next, I investigate the authors' methodologies to process and design uncertainty. Finally, I contribute by exploring future paths for uncertainty visualization.

    * Title: Interactive Visualization on Large High-Resolution Displays: A Survey
    * Year: 08 Dec `2022`
    * Authors: Ilyasse Belkacem, Christian Tominski, Nicolas Médoc, Søren Knudsen, Raimund Dachselt, Mohammad Ghoniem
    * Abstract: In the past few years, large high-resolution displays (LHRDs) have attracted considerable attention from researchers, industries, and application areas that increasingly rely on data-driven decision-making. An up-to-date survey on the use of LHRDs for interactive data visualization seems warranted to summarize how new solutions meet the characteristics and requirements of LHRDs and take advantage of their unique benefits. In this survey, we start by defining LHRDs and outlining the consequence of LHRD environments on interactive visualizations in terms of more pixels, space, users, and devices. Then, we review related literature along the four axes of visualization, interaction, evaluation studies, and applications. With these four axes, our survey provides a unique perspective and covers a broad range of aspects being relevant when developing interactive visual data analysis solutions for LHRDs. We conclude this survey by reflecting on a number of opportunities for future research to help the community take up the still open challenges of interactive visualization on LHRDs.

    * Title: A Survey of Perception-Based Visualization Studies by Task
    * Year: 15 Jul `2021`
    * Authors: Ghulam Jilani Quadri, Paul Rosen
    * Abstract: Knowledge of human perception has long been incorporated into visualizations to enhance their quality and effectiveness. The last decade, in particular, has shown an increase in perception-based visualization research studies. With all of this recent progress, the visualization community lacks a comprehensive guide to contextualize their results. In this report, we provide a systematic and comprehensive review of research studies on perception related to visualization. This survey reviews perception-focused visualization studies since 1980 and summarizes their research developments focusing on low-level tasks, further breaking techniques down by visual encoding and visualization type. In particular, we focus on how perception is used to evaluate the effectiveness of visualizations, to help readers understand and apply the principles of perception of their visualization designs through a task-optimized approach. We concluded our report with a summary of the weaknesses and open research questions in the area.
